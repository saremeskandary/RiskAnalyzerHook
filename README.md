# RiskAnalyzerHook

A comprehensive risk analysis hook for Uniswap V4 liquidity pools that monitors and manages risk through real-time analysis of volatility, liquidity patterns, and position concentrations.

## Overview

RiskAnalyzerHook is a sophisticated risk management system designed for Uniswap V4 pools. It provides real-time monitoring, risk scoring, and automated risk mitigation through a modular architecture of specialized components.

## Features

- **Real-time Risk Analysis**: Continuous monitoring of pool health metrics including:
  - Volatility tracking
  - Liquidity depth analysis
  - Position concentration measurement
  - Price impact assessment

- **Smart Risk Scoring System**: 
  - Multi-factor risk evaluation
  - Customizable risk thresholds
  - Historical data analysis
  - Weighted risk aggregation

- **Automated Risk Management**:
  - Circuit breaker mechanisms
  - Liquidity throttling
  - Emergency shutdown capabilities
  - Automated notifications

- **Comprehensive Monitoring**:
  - Pool-level metrics
  - Position-specific risk tracking
  - System-wide risk assessment
  - Historical trend analysis

## Architecture

The system consists of several core components:

- **RiskAnalyzerHook**: Main hook interface for Uniswap V4 integration
- **VolatilityOracle**: Tracks and calculates price volatility metrics
- **LiquidityScoring**: Analyzes liquidity distribution and depth
- **RiskAggregator**: Combines multiple risk factors into unified scores
- **RiskController**: Executes risk mitigation actions
- **RiskRegistry**: Maintains pool parameters and risk thresholds
- **RiskNotifier**: Handles alerts and notifications

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RiskAnalyzerHook

# Install dependencies
forge install

# Build the project
forge build
```

## Usage

### Deployment

Deploy the hook and its components:

```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url <your_rpc_url> --broadcast
```

### Integration

To integrate with a Uniswap V4 pool:

```solidity
// Create pool with hook
PoolKey memory poolKey = PoolKey({
    currency0: currency0,
    currency1: currency1,
    fee: fee,
    tickSpacing: tickSpacing,
    hooks: IHooks(address(riskAnalyzerHook))
});

// Initialize pool
manager.initialize(poolKey, sqrtPriceX96);
```

### Configuration

Set risk parameters:

```solidity
RiskParameters memory params = RiskParameters({
    volatilityThreshold: 1000,    // 10%
    liquidityThreshold: 1000000,  // Minimum liquidity
    concentrationThreshold: 7500, // 75%
    cooldownPeriod: 1 hours,
    circuitBreakerEnabled: true
});

riskAnalyzerHook.updateRiskParameters(poolId, params);
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
forge test
```

Run with gas reporting:

```bash
forge test --gas-report
```

## Security

This project implements several security measures:

- Reentrancy protection
- Access control mechanisms
- Circuit breakers
- Input validation
- Emergency shutdown capabilities

**Note**: Always perform thorough security audits before deploying to production.
